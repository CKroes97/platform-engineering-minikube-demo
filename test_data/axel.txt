Where & why it matters

Axel sits in the southwest corner of the Netherlands, in the part of Zeeland that borders Belgium (Zeeuws-Vlaanderen). Historically it stood at the mouth of a creek (the Axelse Gat / part of the old Braakman inlet) and functioned as a market/gateway town toward Ghent — which explains its medieval importance and fortifications.

Short history (highlights)

Early origins: settlement mentioned around 987–994; church ca. 1100 and a castle around 1200. Axel received city rights in 1213. 
Wikipedia

Medieval / early modern conflict: Axel was plundered in the late Middle Ages (e.g., by Ghent) and later played a role in the Eighty Years’ War. The Capture of Axel (1586) was a notable Anglo-Dutch action (Maurice of Nassau / Sir Philip Sidney) that secured control of the town.

Flooding & fortifications: the All Saints’ Flood (1570) temporarily turned the town into an island; fortifications were significant in the 16th–17th centuries and removed in the early 19th century. 
Wikipedia

Modern municipal change: Axel remained its own municipality for centuries but was merged into Terneuzen on 1 January 2003.

Demographics / economy / transport

Population has hovered around 7–8k in recent decades (different sources use different boundaries: built-up area vs. statistical area). 
City Population

Economy: typical for a small regional town — local retail, services, some industry nearby (Terneuzen area has more heavy industry and ports). Axel itself functions as a local service and market town for surrounding villages. (Regional economic detail is linked to the wider Terneuzen / Ghent-Terneuzen area.)

Public transport / access: bus services connect Axel to larger towns in Zeeland (e.g., connections toward Goes and Terneuzen). The historic railway line that once served Axel closed (station and line no longer operate). Driving is the fastest way from many Dutch cities; it’s close to the Belgian border so cross-border trips are common.

Recent / wartime notes

During World War II and specifically the Battle of the Scheldt (Sept 1944), Axel saw fighting and was liberated (Polish forces liberated Axel on 19 September 1944). The town still has memorials and local WWII history.
